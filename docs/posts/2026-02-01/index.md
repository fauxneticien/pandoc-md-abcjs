title: "Backing: Out on the Ocean (Part B)"

## Vashon backing

In the Vashon Celtic Tunes chart for [Out on the Ocean](https://www.vashonceltictunes.net/irish/htmchords/outontheocean.htm), the Part B starts out with the `Em` chord:

```
Out On The Ocean
Jig in G

Part A
G G | G D | G G | C D
G G | G D | G G | D G

Part B
Em Em | Em Em | D D | D D
G  G  | C  G  | G G | D G
Em Em | Em Em | D D | D D
G  G  | C  G  | G G | D G
```

## Perhaps obvious?

Perhaps the choice of `vi: E minor: (E - G - B)` is a no brainer, given the melody lands right on the `E` note at both the `1` and `4` down beats (jig in 6/8).

```abcjs
X: 1
R: jig
M: 6/8
L: 1/8
Q: 1/4=100
K: Gmaj
%%barnumbers 1
|"Em""_1"e2e "_4"edB| "Em""_1"ege "_4"edB|
```

## Other options

But just for analysis, let's try out some of the options.

### I: G Major: (G - B - D)

Not horrible, though the major colours it more bright.

```abcjs
X: 1
R: jig
M: 6/8
L: 1/8
Q: 1/4=100
K: Gmaj
%%barnumbers 1
|"G""_1"e2e "_4"edB| "G""_1"ege "_4"edB|
```

### IV: C Major: (C - E - G)

I imagine the same for `C`.

```abcjs
X: 1
R: jig
M: 6/8
L: 1/8
Q: 1/4=100
K: Gmaj
%%barnumbers 1
|"C""_1"e2e "_4"edB| "C""_1"ege "_4"edB|
```

### ii: A minor: (A - C - E)

If not major, then what about another minor?

```abcjs
X: 1
R: jig
M: 6/8
L: 1/8
Q: 1/4=100
K: Gmaj
%%barnumbers 1
|"Am""_1"e2e "_4"edB| "Am""_1"ege "_4"edB|
```

Doesn't quite work either. So I think the `Em` is the very natural choice, having had a closer look at the melody.
